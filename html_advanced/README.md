# HTML Advanced

This and future projects are implementing, from scratch, a webpage from a
designer file. This first project will focus on the HTML structure only. No CSS
or JavaScript.

The designer file will be available on Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/XrEAsu1vQj5fhVaNG38d2W/Homepage)

This is what this project is replicating exactly, but just the HTML of it—no styling.

### Tasks checklist:
[//]: # ("‎" comes before every number because otherwise the numbers will be formatted like "i, ii, iii, iv, etc." instead of "1, 2, 3, 4, etc.")
