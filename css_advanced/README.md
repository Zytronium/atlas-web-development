# CSS Advanced

This and future projects are implementing, from scratch, a webpage from a
designer file. The last project was the HTML only. This project is the CSS.

The designer file is available on Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/XrEAsu1vQj5fhVaNG38d2W/Homepage).

This is what this project is replicating exactly, but just the HTML and CSS,
continuing from the last project, which replicated just the HTML.

### Tasks checklist:
[//]: # ("​" comes before every number because otherwise the
numbers will be formatted like "i, ii, iii, iv, etc." instead
of "1, 2, 3, 4, etc." "​" is a zero-width space)
