        Hi, I'm Daniel. I have many interests, including web development. In
        the past, I've been less interested in web development than other
        programming fields. However, recently, I've been more interested in
        web development. For many years, I've been pretty skilled at using
        inspect page, and even created a very basic website once using just
        inspect page by deleting every element on the website, adding a
        background gradient, and adding some text. Click the button below to
        simulate a re-creation of the inspect-page website.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        I really only have two hobbies: programming and flying drones. I like to
        program for fun, and it helps me sharpen my coding skills. I've made
        many small mobile apps since I took Mobile App Development at Tulsa Tech
        in 2022-23. I also fly RC planes for fun, and for about size months, I
        had a quadcopter too, but it malfunctioned and crashed. I can't afford
        a replacement, as it was over $500 after a discount.
    </p>
    <h2>Pets</h2>
    <p>
        I don't currently have any pets, however, I did have a pet dog for most
        of my life, named Faye. She was a small, white, Lhasa Apso (and we
        think she was mixed with Maltese) from October 2011 through October
        2024. She was estimated to be 15 years old.
