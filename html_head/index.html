        Hi, I'm Daniel. I have many interests, including web development. In
        the past, I've been less interested in web development than other
        programming fields. However, recently, I've been more interested in
        web development. For many years, I've been pretty skilled at using
        inspect page, and even created a very basic website once using just
        inspect page by deleting every element on the website, adding a
        background gradient, and adding some text. Click the button below to
        simulate a re-creation of the inspect-page website.
    </p>
    <button id="simButton">Simulate It</button>
    <p>Of course, there's more to me than just my interest in programming.
        Here's a list of some more of my interests:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Comedy</li>
        <li>Space</li>
        <li>Aviation</li>
        <li>Drones</li>
        <li>Video Games</li>
        <li>Sci-Fi</li>
        <li style="font-family: Xolonium, Arial, sans-serif">Sci-Fi</li>
        <li>Music</li>
        <li>Programming</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here are some fun facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I have my commercial remote pilot license (though I've never used
            it)
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">I think you
            already know this one</a></li>
        <li>My favorite color is teal—roughly the shade of teal that's
        in Atlas School's logo but with slitly less green.</li>
        <li>My least favorite color is orange.</li>
        <li>I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efl-ukB66J8">really</a>

        <li>I own a funny domain. More info below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A few days ago, I noticed a funny domain relating to a certain meme
        was not taken. I had a funny idea for it, so I bought it and made the
        website. Unfortunately, the domain has a cuss word in it (because so
        does the meme), so it might not be a great idea to share it here. It's
        a certain hyper-American meme involving George Washington being
        aggressively ignorant of the Metric system, specifically the kilometer,
        and holding a gun, with an American flag and Bald Eagle in the
        background.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        I really only have two hobbies: programming and flying drones. I like to
        program for fun, and it helps me sharpen my coding skills. I've made
        many small mobile apps since I took Mobile App Development at Tulsa Tech
        in 2022-23. I also fly RC planes for fun, and for about six months, I
        had a quadcopter too, but it malfunctioned and crashed. I can't afford
        a replacement, as it was over $500 even after a discount.
    </p>
    <h2>Pets</h2>
    <p>
        I don't currently have any pets, however, I did have a pet dog for most
        of my life, named Faye. She was a small, white, Lhasa Apso (and we
        think she was mixed with Maltese). We had her from October 2011 through
        October 2024. She was estimated to be 15 years old.
    </p>
    <h2>Why I'm here in Full-Stack</h2>
    <p>
        I came to Atlas School to help improve and refine my coding skills. I'm
        pretty good at teaching myself how to code, but only once I've been
        taught the basics of the field of programming in person. I initially
        enrolled in LAB, but I hate C and I enjoyed the web development I did
        during my Hacksprint and during Winter break. So I switched to
        Full-Stack.
    </p>
    <h2>What I plan to do with my Full-Stack knowledge</h2>
    <p>
        My main career goal is not web development, however that is a good
        starting point for me, and I believe I can use what I learn in this
        class to help me learn other fields of programming as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a list of some of my programming-related career interests:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Video Game Development</li>
        <li>Flight Simulator Development</li>
        <li>Mobile App Development</li>
        <li>Web Development</li>
        <li>Operating System Development</li>
        <li>Anything relating to both aerospace and programming</li>
        <li>Anything that can be useful</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I also plan to use what I learn in this class to improve the ‎<a
