# HTML Head Tag

This project is about the head tag and basic HTML. This project contains a basic
personal about me website made with some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—although the
project plan is only HTML and CSS. The website will contain information about me
(obviously), including an image gallery, and maybe a surprise or two. ;)

Due to unique circumstances, this project will be somewhat rushed; however, I still
want to make it look good, as I am a perfectionist.

### Tasks checklist:
[//]: # ("‎" comes before every number because otherwise the numbers will be formatted like "i, ii, iii, iv, etc." instead of "1, 2, 3, 4, etc.")
