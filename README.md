# Atlas Web Development - Atlas School Full-Stack Web Development Projects
One of the primary repositories for T3 Full-Stack Web Development at Atlas School.

This repository covers the topics I will be working on during my time in T3
(and possibly T4 and 5?) Full-Stack Web Development at Atlas School.

Other repos commonly used during this trimester:
- [atlas-web_front_end](https://github.com/Zytronium/atlas-web_front_end)
- [atlas-web_back_end](https://github.com/Zytronium/atlas-web_back_end)

<summary>Projects Key</summary>

- ### `Course Name`
    - **[Completed project (with link to its directory or repo on GitHub)]()**
    - ***[In Progress Project (with link to its directory or repo on GitHub)]()***
    - *[Future Project (unstarted; empty link)]()*
    - ### **[Major Project (i.e. group project or hack sprint; with link to its repo, or empty link if unstarted)]()**
    - ***[Single Project Split into Multiple Directories for Organization) (in progress; link to first part)]()***
        - **[Project part 1 (completed)]()**
        - ***[Project part 2 (in progress)]()***
        - *[Project part 3 (unstarted)]()*

Projects are (usually) in chronological order, and are separated by courses,
but not by sprints.

<small style="color: lightgrey">
WW1100 and WW1200 were done at the same time, so it is impossible to sort these
both in chronological order and by course. Therefore, they are sorted by course
first and then by chronological order inside the course.
